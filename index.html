            My name is Gustavo Carrillo Castro, hows it going! I'm a computer
            science major graduating Spring 2026 from Portland State University,
            and on track to graduate with honors Summa cum laude. Excited to
            join the workforce and tackle any challenging problems thrown my
            way. My education experience has had me look at everything from
            cybersecurity, and cloud systems to using ai for code generation,
            visual processing, and security audit automation. I also serve as a
            computer science tutor and previously volunteered at the Maseeh
            College of Engineering IT student volunteer group the Computer
            Action Team.

            When not in front of a computer you can find me building legos,
            reading, and chopping through my list of media. Currently going
            through the manga Bleach, reading Red Rising (I know I'm late to the
            party), and probably listening to Saba and Kendrick Lamar. Feel free
            to add me on rym, letterboxd, mal, & goodreads.
