      <h1>Gustavo Carrillo Castro</h1>
      <p class="center-text">
        My name is Gustavo Carrillo Castro, hows it going! I'm a computer
        science major graduating Spring 2026 from Portland State University, and
        on track to graduate with honors Summa cum laude. Excited to join the
        workforce and tackle any challenging problems thrown my way. My
        education experience had me look at everything from cybersecurity, and
        cloud systems to using ai for code generation, visual processing, and
        security audit automation.
        <br /><br />
        When not in front of a computer you can find me building legos, reading,
        and chopping through my list of media. Currently going through the manga
        Bleach, reading Red Rising (I know I'm late to the party), and probably
        listening to Saba and Kendrick Lamar. Feel free to add me on rym,
        letterboxd, mal, & goodreads.
