## CS 463 Final Project - Portfolio Website

This is a vanilla stack (HTML, CSS, and JS) website that i meant to show off 
skils we picked up during CS463 - Intro to Web Dev. It includes an about me
page, a resume/experience page, a projects page and a contact me page. 

The project made use of JS to fetch() and load the navbar html on every page.
As well as to create the project cards from a list of information I provided
in projects.js. CSS features include a navbar that blurs its background, a
glowing effect on images, as well as border highlighting and lifting of cards
on hover. Alongside all the regular theme, layouts, flex, and media query
effects CSS can handle.

You can find the site deployed here [View Site](https://gustav5-cc.github.io/gustav5_webdev_final/)
Or on the right side of this github page under deployments.

If you want to run this site locally you will need to clone or fork the repo
onto your machine and use Liveserver, or some other local server host to 
ensure that calls to fetch() load correctly without being stopped by the 
machines file system protections.
